# PLSearchCPP

PLSearchCPP is a C++ library that approximates Prolog predicates using a continuation-passing style. It provides a framework for defining and executing Prolog-like predicates, including support for backtracking, choice points, and unification.

## Features

- Prolog-like predicates
- Continuation-passing style execution
- Backtracking and choice points
- Unification of terms
- Support for variables, integers, floats, atoms, and lists

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- C++11 or later
- CMake 3.10 or later

### Building the Library

1. Clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/PLSearchCPP.git
cd PLSearchCPP
```

2. Create a build directory and navigate to it:

```sh
mkdir build
cd build
```

3: Run CMake to configure the project:

```sh
cmake ..
```

4: Build the project:

```sh
make
```

This will build the pl_search library and place it in the lib directory.
